**Minima** is a *Simple but Universal Theme* for [Oh My Posh!](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh), Built for `Speed`, `Adaptability`, and `Maximum Portability`.

**Minima** is made for all sorts of Terminal Color Schemes. In Demonstration, `Tokyo Night Storm` is Used.

Customization is Great, but not Inconvenience coming from Ricing. Thus I made a Simple Rice without any Dependencies. My Goal is to make Powershell look like Bash. Her Design is Inspired from the `Default Linux Terminal` and `adb shell` on Rooted Android.

**Latest Version** : `v1.2`

> [!NOTE]
> THIS THEME IS *"NOT FOR NEOVIMMERS & RICING LEGENDS ON ARCH"* NOR *"VERY ADVANCED USERS"*
> 
>( No Offense to Arch Linux nor Neovim. This is Just a Joke on Flexers and Ricing Legends. Sorry! :) )

## Key Features :

- No Need for Nerd Font. ✅
- Extremely Minimal and Fast. ✅
- Familiar from the Start, Consistent on ALL SYSTEMS. ✅
- Works on ANY Theme. ✅
- Handles Root Mode / Administrator Terminal using `$` or `#`, a Classic Linux-Style Convention. ✅
- NO BLOAT. This doesn't have `Git Checks`, `Time`, `Newline` or `Fancy Iconography`. ✅
- Works Perfectly on Any Garbage Terminal, even `conhost.exe` that we know has Command Prompt. ✅
- Brings the Linux Terminal Style to `Windows Powershell` ( if using Windows! ) ✅
