**Minima** is a *Simple Theme* for [Oh My Posh!](https://github.com/jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh), based on `Tokyo Night Storm Colour` Scheme, Built for `Speed` and `Maximum Portability`.

Customization is Great, but not Inconvenience coming from Ricing. Thus I made a Simple Rice without any Dependencies. My Goal is to make Powershell look like Bash. Her Design is Inspired from the `Default Linux Terminal` and `adb shell` on Rooted Android.

THIS THEME IS *NOT FOR NEOVIMMERS ON ARCH* NOR *VERY ADVANCED USERS* 

( No Offense to Arch Linux nor Neovim. This is Just a Joke on Flexers. Sorry! :) )

## Key Features :

- No Need for Nerd Font. ✅
- Extremely Minimal and Fast. ✅
- Handles Root Mode / Administrator Terminal using `$` or `#`, a Classic Linux-Style Convention. ✅
- NO BLOAT. This doesn't have `Git Checks`, `Time`, `Newline` or `Fancy Iconography`. ✅
- Works Perfectly on Any Garbage Terminal, even `conhost.exe` that we know has Command Prompt. ✅
- Brings the Linux Terminal Style to `Windows Powershell` ( if using Windows! ) ✅

## Portability Showcase ( In conhost.exe ) :

Microsoft, if you are Seeing this, Please Rmeove this from Home Systems, if not all. It's Terrible 🙏
